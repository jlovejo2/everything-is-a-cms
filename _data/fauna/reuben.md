Reuben is a melty sandwich consisting of a combination of corned beef, rye bread, sauerkraut, Russian dressing, and Swiss cheese. According to one out of many theories, it was invented in 1914 at Manhattan's Reuben Delicatessen by its owner, Arnold Reuben, when an out-of-work actress ordered something new, and Arnold made her a Reuben sandwich.

Since the combination of meat and cheese is not kosher, it is unusual to know that the sandwich was invented in a Jewish deli. However, it is part of the Jewish culture in North America and it can, of course, be enjoyed by those who are not Orthodox Jews.

Just like most popular food, Reuben also has numerous variations such as Rachel sandwich, grouper Reuben, West Coast Reuben, Montreal Reuben and Reuben egg rolls. Savory, sloppy and extremely satisfying, Reuben remains a staple of New Yorker cuisine.
