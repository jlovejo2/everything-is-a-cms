A true American icon, club sandwich consists of bacon, cooked chicken breast, tomatoes, and lettuce sandwiched between a few slices of toasted bread with mayonnaise. The sandwich is closely linked to hotels and resorts as a popular menu item, its name believed to come from its popularity at country clubs.

The most popular theory about its origin says that it was invented in 1894 at Saratoga Club-House in New York. The oldest recipe was found in a cookbook called the Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book from 1903, written by Isabel Gordon Curtis.
